                    <p><b>Mario</b>, the brave and iconic plumber in red, is the heart of the franchise. He's known for his heroic missions to save Princess Peach and stop Bowser's plans. With his cheerful personality and super jumps, Mario represents courage, adventure, and fun in the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>

                    <p><b>Luigi</b> is Mario’s loyal younger brother. Often more cautious and nervous than Mario, Luigi shines in ghost-hunting adventures and solo games like <b>Luigi’s Mansion</b>. His green outfit and taller frame make him a fan-favorite underdog with plenty of heart.</p>

                <p><a href="https://supermarioplay.com/", target="_blank"><b>Super Mario bros</b>:</a> In Mario’s first standalone adventure, his design was simple but iconic: red hat, blue overalls, mustache, and big nose—created with limited pixels but maximum personality. The game’s story was straightforward: rescue Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser, who had taken over the Mushroom Kingdom with an army of Goombas, Koopa Troopas, and dangerous traps. The goal was to run, jump, and fight through 8 worlds to reach the final castle to save the Princess and defeat bowser.</p>

He could now pick up and throw items, crouch, and even hover—depending on which character you played. The story here was very different: Mario dreams of a strange land called Subcon, where an evil frog named Wart has taken over. It wasn’t just Mario this time—Luigi, Toad, and Peach were all playable, each with different abilities.</p>

His eyes and mouth were more expressive, and his movement was smoother than ever. Set on Dinosaur Land, this game introduced Yoshi as Mario’s trusty companion. Bowser returns and kidnaps Princess Toadstool again. With a huge world map, secret exits, and power-ups like the Cape Feather, Mario had never felt more adventurous.</p>

His eyes were expressive, his clothes got dirty or wet, and he wore a short-sleeved outfit to match the tropical vibe. In a twist, Mario is falsely accused of polluting Isle Delfino and must clean it up with the help of FLUDD, a robotic water-spraying backpack. This was one of the first games to give Mario fully voiced cutscenes.</p>

He wore a space suit and his cap had a star emblem. The story took Mario to outer space, where he must save Princess Peach from Bowser, who has stolen the Power Stars to create his own galaxy. The game introduced gravity-defying gameplay, allowing Mario to walk on spherical planets and use power-ups like the Bee Mushroom and Boo Mushroom.</p>
